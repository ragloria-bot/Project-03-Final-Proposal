1. **What Went Well?**  

- The creative process of envisioning my final project was  
not only fun but also incredibly exciting. As I went through  
into my ideas, I found myself brainstorming various concepts  
and visuals that could effectively convey my vision. I  
explored different styles and techniques, considering how  
each element would contribute to the overall impact of the  
project. The thrill of piecing everything together and  
imagining the final result kept me engaged and motivated,  
allowing my creativity to flourish. Each step of the way  
was filled with discovery and inspiration, making the  
journey as rewarding as the outcome itself.

2. **What Didn't Go So Well?**  

- I successfully created my style.css file without any  
major issues, however, integrating additional features  
turned out to be somewhat challenging. One specific  
challenge I faced was when I tried to center my images  
of a snow cone on the web pages in a row. Despite my  
efforts, the image kept aligning to the left side  
instead of being positioned in the center. 

3. **What Did We Learn?**  

 - To resolve the problem of multiple images appearing  
 on the left side of the web pages, I carefully examined  
 and adjusted various CSS properties, particularly  
 focusing on margin and display settings. I experimented  
 with different values to find the optimal configuration  
 that would align the images with the rest of the content.  
 This process not only resolved the layout issue but also  
 deepened my understanding of CSS positioning and the  
 critical role it plays in web design. I learned that even  
 minor adjustments can lead to significant changes in the  
 overall aesthetics and user experience of a website. This  
 experience reinforced my appreciation for the intricacies  
 of CSS and its impact on creating visually appealing and  
 functional web pages. Â 
 
4. **What Can I Improve for Next Time?**  

- I will invest more time in advance to explore and master  
advanced CSS techniques. By doing so, I will be able to style  
my webpage more effectively and with ease. A deeper understanding  
of CSS will not only enhance my skill set but also provide a  
wider variety of styling options, allowing for more creative  
and visually appealing designs. This knowledge will empower  
me to create responsive layouts, utilize animations, and  
implement custom styles that improve user experience  
and engagement.
