1. **What Went Well?**  

- Positive stakeholder feedback on a key deliverable.  

- The team collaborated effectively to solve a complex problem.  

2. **What Didn't Go So Well?**  

- The project experienced unexpected delays primarily due to  
limitations in available resources, including staffing shortages  
and supply chain disruptions. These constraints hindered our  
ability to meet deadlines and maintain the planned workflow. As  
a result, we are actively working to identify alternative  
solutions to mitigate these delays and ensure the project  
stays on track moving forward.  

3. **What Did We Learn?**  

 - Our experience showed that implementing daily instead of weekly  
 stand-up meetings significantly improved communication among  
 different teams.These brief meetings provided a structured  
 opportunity for team members to share updates, address any  
 obstacles they were facing, and align their goals. As a result,  
 we noticed a more collaborative atmosphere, with teams better  
 informed about each other's projects and progress, ultimately  
 leading to increased productivity and efficiency.  
 
4. **What Can We Improve for Next Time?**

Establish daily meetings instead of weekly meetings to  
meet phase dealines.  

- **Action Item 2:**  
Have more staff avaliable for project development for  
unexpected shortages or delays.
