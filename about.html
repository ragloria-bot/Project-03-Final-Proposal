    <h1>Get to Know Us</h1>

  <p> Our founder Jack Frost, a long time resident of Anytown, USA, started  
    Arctic Treats in 2020 with a simple mission: to bring joy and refreshment  
    to the community through delicious snow cones. What began as a small stand  
    at local events has blossomed into a beloved neighborhood fixture, known  
    for our friendly service and mouth-watering flavors. We are passionate  
    about creating memorable experiences for our customers, whether it's a  
    family outing or a quick treat on a hot day. At Arctic Treats, we believe  
    that every snow cone is more than just a dessert; it's a moment of  
    happiness shared with friends and family. Join us at our two convenient  
    locations celebrating the simple pleasures of life, one snow cone at a time!
